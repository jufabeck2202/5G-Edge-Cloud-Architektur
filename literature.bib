  abstract = {Segment routing (SR) has emerged as a promising source-routing methodology to overcome the challenges in the current routing schemes. It has received noticeable attention both in industry and academia, due to its flexibility, scalability, and applicability, especially in software defined networks. The emerging cloud services require strict service level agreements such as packet loss, delay, and jitter. Studies have shown that traditional network architectures lack the essential flexibility and scalability to offer these services. To combat this, a more flexible and agile routing paradigm of SR enables a source node to steer an incoming packet along a performance engineered path represented as an ordered list of instructions called segment list. This is encoded as a multiprotocol label switching label stack or an IPv6 address list in the packet header. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the novel SR technology by describing its architecture, operations, and key applications to date. SR paradigm can be effectively applied to a wide range of network applications, such as traffic engineering, network resiliency, network monitoring, and service function chaining, to achieve efficient network solutions. Furthermore, this paper identifies an interesting set of future research directions and open issues that can help realize the full potential of the emergent SR paradigm.},

  abstract = {One of the key targets of the upcoming 5G system is to build a mobile network architecture that supports not only classical mobile broadband applications (i.e., Internet and IMS), but also vertical industry services, such as those of automotive systems, e-health, public safety, and smart grid. Vertical industry is known to have specific needs that cannot be sustained by the current cellular networks. More notably, automotive systems require strict quality of service in terms of ultrashort latency for vehicle-toinfrastructure/network (V2I/N) communications. In this paper, we introduce the Follow Me edge-Cloud (FMeC) concept, leveraging the mobile edge computing (MEC) architecture to sustain requirements of the 5G automotive systems. Assuming that automotive services are deployed on MEC entities, FMeC ensures low-latency access to these services by guaranteeing that vehicles (i.e., as well as user equipment on board vehicles) always connect to nearest automotive service. Besides the FMeC architecture, our contribution in this paper consists in presenting a projection of the FMeC solution on an automated driving use case that integrates automotive and Telco infrastructures, to realize the vision of future 5G automotive systems. We introduce the envisioned software defined networking/OpenFlow-based architecture and our mobility-aware framework based on a set of building blocks that permit achieving the automated driving requirements within 5G network. The evaluation results, obtained conjointly through theoretical analysis and computer simulation, show that our proposed solution outperforms baseline approaches in meeting the automated driving latency requirement and minimizing the incurred global cost.},

  abstract = {Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Network Slicing techniques have a potential to augment 5G-IoT network services. Telecommunication operators use a diverse set of radio access technologies to provide services for users. Mobility management is one such service that needs attention for new 5G deployments. The QoS requirements in 5G networks are user specific. Network slicing along with MEC has been promoted as a key enabler for such on-demand service schemes. This paper focuses on radio resource access across heterogeneous networks for mobile roaming users. A unified service architecture is proposed enabling seamless handover between a 5G (New Generation Core) service and a 4G (Evolved Packet Core) service via the network slicing paradigm. An identifierlocator (I-L) concept that allows active source-IP sessions is used to handle the seamless hand-over. Signaling costs, service disruptions and other resource reservation requirements are considered in the evaluation to assure that profit for mobile edge operators is achieved. Simulation experiments are considered to provide performance comparisons against the state-of-the-art Distributed Mobility Management Protocol (DMM).},

  abstract = {Future applications such as driverless cars, industrial Internet and smart grids will demand high bandwidth, resilience, security and low latency communication at the same time. Those technical requirements will be met by the 5G communication system, which is not only focusing on the future air interface but also the deployment in the core network. The paradigm shift from agnostic store-and-forward towards intelligent networks paves the ground for the mobile edge cloud a concept to not only place cloud computing in close proximity to the users or things, such as in the base stations or even in access points in the houses, but also move the cloud with the user as the device moves along the network. This would enable minimum latency services, which require advanced migration techniques that facilitate not just quick but very frequent migrations. In this paper, we study and compare the state of the art migration techniques offered by virtualization tools like docker and KVM and propose an application level migration protocol that eliminates the drawbacks of the former. We also present the implementation of the proposed protocol in a latency sensitive gaming application, where the server is migrated live during the gameplay between hosts, transparently to the users, as a proof of concept and study the handover in detail.},

Existing frameworks managing and orchestrating MEC and NFV are either tightly coupled or completely separated. The former design is inflexible and increases the complexity of one framework. Whereas, the latter leads to inefficient use of computation resources because information are not shared. We introduce APMEC, a dedicated framework for MEC while enabling the collaboration with the management and orchestration (MANO) frameworks for NFV. The new design allows to reuse allocated network services, thus maximizing resource utilization. Measurement results have shown that APMEC can allocate up to 60\% more number of network services. Being developed on top of OpenStack, APMEC is an open source project, available for collaboration and facilitating further research activities.},

  abstract = {Service function chaining (SFC) is promising to implement flexible and scalable virtual network infrastructure for the Internet of Things (IoT). Edge computing is envisioned to be an effective solution to process huge amount of IoT application data. In order to uniformly provide services to IoT applications among the distributed edge computing nodes (ECNs), we present a unified SFC orchestration framework based on the coordination of SDN and NFV, which provides a synergic edge cloud platform by exploiting the connectivity of FiWi access networks. In addition, we study the VNF deployment problem under our synergic framework, and we formulate it as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem jointly considering the load balancing of networking and computing for chaining VNFs. We also propose two approximation optimal deployment algorithms named Greedy-Bisection Multi-Path (GBMP) and KSP MultiPath (KSMP) taking advantage of the multi-instance virtual network functions (VNFs) deployed in ECNs and the multipath capacity in FiWi access networks. Extensive simulations are conducted in two types of IoT application scenarios in the EC over FiWi access networks. The numerical results show that our proposed algorithms are superior to single path and ECMP based deployment algorithms in terms of load balancing, service acceptance ratio, and network utilization in both two typical scenarios.},

  abstract = {The fifth generation of cellular networks (5G) will rely on edge cloud deployments to satisfy the ultra-low latency demand of future applications. In this paper, we argue that such deployments can also be used to enable advanced data-driven and Machine Learning (ML) applications in mobile networks. We propose an edge-controller-based architecture for cellular networks and evaluate its performance with real data from hundreds of base stations of a major U.S. operator. In this regard, we will provide insights on how to dynamically cluster and associate base stations and controllers, according to the global mobility patterns of the users. Then, we will describe how the controllers can be used to run ML algorithms to predict the number of users in each base station, and a use case in which these predictions are exploited by a higher-layer application to route vehicular traffic according to network Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). We show that the prediction accuracy improves when based on machine learning algorithms that rely on the controllers’ view and, consequently, on the spatial correlation introduced by the user mobility, with respect to when the prediction is based only on the local data of each single base station.},

The 5G-MEDIA approach aims at delivering an integrated programmable service platform for the development, design and operations of media applications in 5G networks by providing mechanisms to flexibly adapt service operations to dynamic conditions and react upon events (e.g. to transparently accommodate auto-scaling of resources, VNF replacement, etc.).

  abstract = {Network slicing has been proposed as an innovative concept to partition a physical network into different configurable slices, thereby allowing the network to meet the diverse requirements of expected services in the 5G era. Existing network-slicing schemes focus almost exclusively on the partitioning of the core network or the radio access network. However, to achieve greater flexibility and better resource utilization in service provisioning, the potential of network slicing in the 5G optical mobile fronthaul (MFH) network should be jointly exploited. To address this challenge, we propose a flexible hierarchical edge cloud architecture to enable 5G optical MFH network slicing. Additionally, a corresponding integrated network resource management scheme is proposed to support various quality-of-service (QoS) requirements and diverse resource requests of the network slices. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme is able to jointly allocate the bandwidth resources to network slices and realize cloud-computing offloading to meet various QoS requirements, and therefore reduce the fronthaul bandwidth burden.},
