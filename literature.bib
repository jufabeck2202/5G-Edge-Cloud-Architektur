	abstract = {Segment routing ({SR}) has emerged as a promising source-routing methodology to overcome the challenges in the current routing schemes. It has received noticeable attention both in industry and academia, due to its ﬂexibility, scalability, and applicability, especially in software deﬁned networks. The emerging cloud services require strict service level agreements such as packet loss, delay, and jitter. Studies have shown that traditional network architectures lack the essential ﬂexibility and scalability to offer these services. To combat this, a more ﬂexible and agile routing paradigm of {SR} enables a source node to steer an incoming packet along a performance engineered path represented as an ordered list of instructions called segment list. This is encoded as a multiprotocol label switching label stack or an {IPv}6 address list in the packet header. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the novel {SR} technology by describing its architecture, operations, and key applications to date. {SR} paradigm can be effectively applied to a wide range of network applications, such as trafﬁc engineering, network resiliency, network monitoring, and service function chaining, to achieve efﬁcient network solutions. Furthermore, this paper identiﬁes an interesting set of future research directions and open issues that can help realize the full potential of the emergent {SR} paradigm.},

	abstract = {Service function chaining ({SFC}) is promising to implement flexible and scalable virtual network infrastructure for the Internet of Things ({IoT}). Edge computing is envisioned to be an effective solution to process huge amount of {IoT} application data. In order to uniformly provide services to {IoT} applications among the distributed edge computing nodes ({ECNs}), we present a unified {SFC} orchestration framework based on the coordination of {SDN} and {NFV}, which provides a synergic edge cloud platform by exploiting the connectivity of {FiWi} access networks. In addition, we study the {VNF} deployment problem under our synergic framework, and we formulate it as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming ({MINLP}) problem jointly considering the load balancing of networking and computing for chaining {VNFs}. We also propose two approximation optimal deployment algorithms named Greedy-Bisection Multi-Path ({GBMP}) and {KSP} {MultiPath} ({KSMP}) taking advantage of the multi-instance virtual network functions ({VNFs}) deployed in {ECNs} and the multipath capacity in {FiWi} access networks. Extensive simulations are conducted in two types of {IoT} application scenarios in the {EC} over {FiWi} access networks. The numerical results show that our proposed algorithms are superior to single path and {ECMP} based deployment algorithms in terms of load balancing, service acceptance ratio, and network utilization in both two typical scenarios.},

	abstract = {Multi-access edge computing ({MEC}) is an emerging ecosystem, which aims at converging telecommunication and {IT} services, providing a cloud computing platform at the edge of the radio access network. {MEC} offers storage and computational resources at the edge, reducing latency for mobile end users and utilizing more efﬁciently the mobile backhaul and core networks. This paper introduces a survey on {MEC} and focuses on the fundamental key enabling technologies. It elaborates {MEC} orchestration considering both individual services and a network of {MEC} platforms supporting mobility, bringing light into the different orchestration deployment options. In addition, this paper analyzes the {MEC} reference architecture and main deployment scenarios, which offer multitenancy support for application developers, content providers, and third parties. Finally, this paper overviews the current standardization activities and elaborates further on open research challenges.},
